/**
  * Sometimes you need to compare lists of number, but sorting each one normally will take too much time.
  * Instead you can use alternative methods to find the differences between each list.
  *
  * Challenge
  * Numeros The Artist was arranging two identical lists A and B into specific orders.
  * The arrangements of the two arrays were random, Numeros was very proud of his arrangements.
  * Unfortunately, some numbers got left out of List A.
  * Can you find the missing numbers from A without messing up his order?
  *
  * Details
  * There are many duplicates in the lists, but you need to find the extra numbers, i.e.
  * B - A. Print the numbers in numerical order. Print each missing number once,
  * even if it is missing multiple times. The numbers are all within a range of 100 from each other.
  *
  * Input Format
  * There will be four lines of input:
  *
  * n - the size of the first list
  * This is followed by n numbers that makes up the first list.
  * m - the size of the second list
  * This is followed by m numbers that makes up the second list.
  *
  * Output Format
  * Output all the numbers (in ascending order) that are in B but not in A.
  *
  * Constraints
  * 1<= n,m <= 200000
  * -10000 <= x <= 10000 , x âˆˆ B
  * Xmax - Xmin < 101
  *
  * Sample Input
  *
  * 10
  * 203 204 205 206 207 208 203 204 205 206
  * 13
  * 203 204 204 205 206 207 205 208 203 206 205 206 204
  * Sample Output
  *
  * 204 205 206
  * Explanation
  *
  * Although 204 presented in both arrays, but 204's frequency in A is smaller than that of B.
  * Similarly 205 and 206 occur twice in A but thrice in B. So, these three numbers constitute the output.
  * The rest of the numbers occur at least as many times in A as they do in B - so they are not "missing numbers".
